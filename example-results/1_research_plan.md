**Research Instructions**

I want you to research and recommend suitable pets for a **9-year-old child**. Please **do not assume any specific household constraints** unless noted below; treat unspecified attributes as **open-ended** and present options across a range of situations.

---

### 1. Scope & Key Dimensions to Analyze
Evaluate potential pets across the following dimensions:

- **Child factors**
  - Typical responsibility level of a 9-year-old
  - Safety (risk of bites, scratches, allergies, disease)
  - Educational and emotional benefits (empathy, routine, learning)
  - Level of adult supervision required

- **Pet care requirements**
  - Daily time commitment
  - Feeding and cleaning needs
  - Lifespan and long-term commitment
  - Veterinary care and typical costs
  - Space requirements (apartment vs. house)

- **Pet temperament**
  - Friendliness toward children
  - Tolerance of handling/noise
  - Ease of training or interaction

- **Practical considerations**
  - Cost range (initial + ongoing)
  - Noise level
  - Odor and cleanliness
  - Legal or housing restrictions (where relevant)

---

### 2. Pet Categories to Include
Research and compare at least the following categories:

- Small mammals (e.g., hamster, guinea pig, rabbit)
- Fish (e.g., betta, goldfish, small community aquarium)
- Reptiles or amphibians (clearly note special care needs)
- Birds (small species appropriate for beginners)
- Cats and dogs (emphasize breeds or types best suited for children)
- Low-maintenance or “starter” pets (e.g., insects, virtual responsibility pets if relevant)

---

### 3. Comparative Analysis
- Include a **comparison table** summarizing:
  - Pet type
  - Pros for a 9-year-old
  - Cons/risks
  - Adult involvement level (low / medium / high)
  - Estimated cost
  - Recommended supervision level

---

### 4. Recommendations
- Identify:
  - **Best overall pets** for most 9-year-olds
  - **Best low-maintenance option**
  - **Best pet for teaching responsibility**
- Clearly explain **why** each is suitable.

---

### 5. Sources
- Prioritize **primary and authoritative sources**, such as:
  - Veterinary associations (e.g., AVMA)
  - Animal welfare organizations (e.g., ASPCA, RSPCA)
  - Pediatric or child-development experts
- Cite sources clearly.

---

### 6. Output Format
Please deliver a **structured report** with:
- Clear section headers
- At least one comparison table
- Bullet points for readability
- A short summary section with actionable guidance for parents

If regional differences matter (laws, availability, costs), note that these factors are **variable and location-dependent**.
